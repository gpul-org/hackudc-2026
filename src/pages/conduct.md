title: HackUDC 2026 â€” Code of Conduct
---

> Be respectful. Any form of harrassment will not be tolerated.

From the HackUDC organization (GPUL), we believe that every participant has the right to take part in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harrassment includes a range of behaviors, including but not limited to, offensive verbal or written comments pertaining to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, socual class or economic status. This includes sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, predatory photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or events, inappropiate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If your actions cause someone to feel uncomfortable, they constitute harrassment and is reason enough to cease them.

Participants who are requested to cease any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and any other individual present at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Notably, attendees are prohibited from utilizing sexualized images, activities, or materials in their projects or during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) are not permitted to wear sexualized clothing, uniforms, or costumes and must not create a sexualized environment.

Should a participant engage in harassing behavior, the organization may take any action deemed appropriate, including issuing a warning to the offender or expelling them from the event or any online platforms utilized during the hackathon, without the right to a refund, return, or receipt of any gifts.

If you are experiencing harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers using the reporting procedures outlined below.

Event organizers will be pleased to assist participants in contacting campus security or local law enforcement, providing escorts, or otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to feel secure throughout the event.

We anticipate that participants will adhere to these regulations in all hackathon venues, online interactions related to the event, social gatherings associated with the hackathon, and hackathon-provided transportation.
