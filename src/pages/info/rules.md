- **Mandatory Free Software License**: All projects must be submitted with a free software license. Please ensure that you include it on your project.
- **Mentor Support**: A team of mentors will be available at all times to help you with your ideas and the technical aspects of your projects. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you have any questions or get stuck.
- **Collaboration Between Teams Allowed**: Colaboration between teams is encouraged! Sharing knowledge is part of the experience, and the event will be more fun if you work alongside your peers.
- **Participating in Multiple Challenges**: Don't limit yourself to just one challenge. Feel free to showcase your skills in more than one category!
